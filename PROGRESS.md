# Build log — Flipit SPV Investor Portal

One section per work package. Newest at the bottom.
The **Uncertain** and **Deviations** sections are the ones worth reading.

## WP0 — Scaffold — done

**Built:** the shell of the application. Next.js with TypeScript in strict mode, Tailwind, the FLIPIT palette wired in as theme colours, and the "Made by Make with Mike" footer on every page. Prisma, Vitest, Zod and decimal.js installed. A landing page that reports which deployment it is and whether sending is permitted from it. `.env.example` documenting every variable and why it exists.

The environment module validates everything at boot and refuses to start the app if anything is missing or malformed — a wrong encryption key or base URL should stop the process, not be discovered later.

`basePath` is wired from the environment, verified working: with `BASE_PATH=/SPV`, the root returns 404, `/SPV` returns 200, and static assets are correctly prefixed.

**Decisions:**

- *Deployment guard implemented at WP0 rather than WP7.* AC44 says the app must refuse to send when its base URL is not the production value. I put the comparison in the environment module now so every later package can read `isProductionDeployment` rather than each re-deriving it. The comparison ignores trailing slashes and case.
- *Google sign-in variables are optional in the schema.* The app must start without them so the database and import work can be built and tested before OAuth credentials exist. WP2 will fail loudly at sign-in if they are absent rather than blocking boot.
- *Tailwind v4 `@theme` block* rather than a JS config — that is what this Tailwind version wants. Palette values are also exported from `src/lib/brand.ts` for anything generating colour outside CSS, such as the PDF certificate and the HTML email.

**Deviations:**

- *Next.js 16, not 15.* `create-next-app@latest` now ships 16. It is the same App Router architecture and nothing in the spec depends on 15. Flagging it because the task file names 15 explicitly.
- *Local Postgres runs on port 5433*, not the default 5432, to avoid colliding with anything already listening. Only affects `DATABASE_URL`.

**Checklist:** points 8, 9 and 12 apply at this stage. No logging of any credential exists yet — there is no logging at all. Every route is `noindex` by default via root metadata, with the verification page in WP14 to opt back in as the single exception. The production guard is implemented and has four tests covering it.

**Uncertain:**

- The palette came from the demo HTML file, not from flipit.com — the live site returns nothing useful to an automated fetch. It needs a two-minute eyeball check against the real site before launch.
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `AUTH_SECRET` in the local `.env` are throwaway development values. They must be regenerated for any real deployment. Noted again in TEST_ME.md.
